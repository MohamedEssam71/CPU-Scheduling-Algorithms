# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms
This Java program simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms, pivotal in operating system design. The assignment entails implementing the following schedulers:

1. **Non-Preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF) with Context Switching**
2. **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) Scheduling with Starvation Problem Solution**
3. **Non-preemptive Priority Scheduling with Starvation Problem Solution**
4. **AG Scheduling (with Round Robin (RR) Algorithm)**
    - The AG scheduling algorithm integrates a new factor derived from priority, arrival time, and burst time.
    - It comprises non-preemptive AG and preemptive AG scenarios based on quantum time usage.
    - Three scenarios dictate the handling of running processes:
        - Process exhausts its quantum time and still has pending tasks.
        - Process doesn't utilize all of its quantum time.
        - Process completes its job.

These schedulers play a pivotal role in resource utilization and system performance optimization. The program offers a hands-on exploration of CPU scheduling algorithms, their intricacies, and their profound impact on system behavior.
